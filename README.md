# Invoice Reader

## Project Overview
Invoice Reader is a Node.js-based application that extracts and processes invoice data from PDF and image files. It utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to identify key details like invoice numbers, dates, amounts, and vendor names, making financial record-keeping more efficient.

## Features
- **OCR-based Invoice Extraction**: Reads text from invoices using Tesseract.js or a similar OCR engine.
- **Multi-format Support**: Processes PDF and image files (PNG, JPG, TIFF, etc.).
- **Data Structuring**: Extracts key invoice fields and structures them in JSON format.
- **Automated Processing**: Batch processing for multiple invoices.
- **Search & Filtering**: Allows users to search extracted invoices by date, vendor, or amount.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express.js)
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract.js (or an alternative)
- **File Handling**: Multer for file uploads
- **Database**: MongoDB (if applicable)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whatevaman1/Invoice-Reader.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Invoice-Reader
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node core/index.js
   ```

## Usage
- Upload invoices via the web interface (if applicable) or place files in the `uploads` folder.
- Process invoices using the API endpoint: `POST /process-invoice`.
- Retrieve structured data in JSON format.
- Search for invoices using API filters.

## Deployment
To deploy the project online:
1. Use a cloud hosting service that supports Node.js (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS).
2. Set up environment variables for API keys, database connection, and OCR configurations.
3. Ensure the server runs continuously using PM2 or a similar process manager.
